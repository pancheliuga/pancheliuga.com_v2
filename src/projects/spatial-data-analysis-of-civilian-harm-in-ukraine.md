lead: 'This project aims to extract statistical insights and produce a meaningful cartographic visualization of civilian harm in Ukraine.
The data for this project based on incidents in Ukraine that have resulted in potential civilian harm. This data began collection by the OSINT group [Bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/) on February 24, 2022, and intends to be a living document that will continue to be updated as long as the war persists.
All computations were made in the Jupyter notebook, and I really like Jupyter for its ability to represent your work without additional storytelling in the article.'
