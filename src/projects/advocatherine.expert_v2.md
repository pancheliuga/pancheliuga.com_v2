## Problem Statement

With the aim of revamping a [previous website](https://github.com/pancheliuga/advocatherine.expert), our objectives were twofold. Firstly, to ensure seamless user experiences on mobile devices — critical as 88% of users access the site through smartphones. Secondly, to enhance user engagement with additional contact forms and dedicated landing pages for distinct legal services. These enhancements had to be balanced with a focus on minimal download speed due to potential disruptions from power outages [caused by missile attacks on Ukraine's energy structure](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_strikes_against_Ukrainian_infrastructure_(2022%E2%80%93present)>).

## Solution

Building upon the foundations of the [previous iteration](http://web.archive.org/web/20230328232917/https://advocatherine.expert/), which leveraged Eleventy.js – a Static Site Generator (SSG), this project adopted the [Jamstack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamstack) approach. The existing [Eleventy-based website template](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent) served as a robust starting point. The development process unfolded collaboratively, involving a UI Designer and me (read "solution architect"), with the latter overseeing the Jamstack architecture, ensuring optimal performance, and crafting the technological underpinnings.

## Features/Highlights

- The introduction of an enhanced Eleventy development structure rooted in a super approach - https://www.lenesaile.com/en/blog/organizing-the-eleventy-config-file/.
- The utilization of a cutting-edge Eleventy starter template - https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent, providing a robust backbone for the project.
- Embracing the paradigm of "Excellent Websites" - https://buildexcellentwebsit.es/, which marries modern CSS methodologies, fluid typography, flexible layouts, and progressive enhancement.
- Efficient image handling via the Eleventy image plugin - https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/.
- Deployment on the [Netlify platform](https://www.netlify.com/) for seamless CI/CD integration, DNS management, and form handling with Slack integration.

## Design and UX

By aligning with the ["Excellent Websites" paradigm](https://buildexcellentwebsit.es/), the project ensured a compelling blend of modern CSS methodologies, fluid typography, flexible layouts, and progressive enhancement. The Jamstack architecture empowered high performance, promoting superior user experiences. A key success metric was achieving a near-perfect Lighthouse score, signifying enhanced user interaction, SEO potential, and site performance.

## Technology Stack

- Jamstack architecture with Eleventy SSG at its core.
- Git as the content management system (CMS).
- Front-end technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Leveraging Netlify PaaS for DNS management, CI/CD integration, and advanced form handling with Slack integration.

## Challenges and Solutions

Transitioning from the previous Gulp-based assembly and Sass usage to a more streamlined modern CSS approach was a challenge. However, the structured Eleventy development methodology inspired by [Lene Saile](https://www.lenesaile.com/) provided an elegant solution.

## Results and Impact

The revamped Attorney at Law website - https://advocatherine.expert/ has significantly elevated the attorney's online visibility and engagement with potential clients. The inclusion of additional contact forms has fostered a fresh stream of leads. Crucially, the project's focus on high Lighthouse metrics has engendered an enriched user experience and elevated search engine ranking.

## Afterword

This website is particularly meaningful to me, as it is ==my wife's personal brand website==. As a project developer, I hold the "power" to make it public on [GitHub](https://github.com/pancheliuga/advocatherine.expert_v2). Much of the code was contributed by brilliant minds, and I encourage you to integrate portions of this project into your own endeavors. Together, we can further enhance the digital landscape with exceptional websites that merge expertise and innovation.
