lead: "The main goal of this project was to implement my Google Earth Engine skills and dive deeper into SAR remote sensing analysis techniques.
Using SAR data on flood mapping is a standard and reliable method for determining the extent of significant floods. The main advantage of using microwave data is that it can penetrate cloud cover, operate in any weather conditions, and provide timely and crucial information both day and night since it is not dependent on sunlight for reflectance."
