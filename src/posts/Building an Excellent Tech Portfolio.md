{% aside %} **DISCLAIMER**: üëâüö´ "I don't intend for my site to assert the title of =='Excellent.'== Rather, this reference aligns with the contemporary approach (principles) of web development outlined by Andy Bell at https://buildexcellentwebsit.es/ and implemented by Lene Saile through her work on Eleventy Excellent at https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent. I incorporated these principles in the development of my site." üë®‚ÄçüíªüöÄ {% endaside %}

In the fast-paced world of tech innovation, a portfolio isn't just a repository of projects ‚Äî it's a mirror reflecting your journey, skills, and aspirations. While numerous platforms cater to blogging and content creation, I've found myself vibing with the [indie web](https://indieweb.org/) movement. Or, you know, I might just be playfully masquerading as an indie web enthusiast ‚Äî when in truth, my ulterior motive is nothing more than wanting to stroke my own ego with a site bearing my name. ü§îüåêüíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Anyhow, in an era marked by individual disruptions of massive platforms (a nod to the likes of Elon Musk and his influence on Twitter), the notion of a personal digital haven becomes alluring. Beyond the allure, lies the intriguing engineering challenge of creating one's own blog ‚Äî a challenge that encompasses design, framework selection, tool integration, direct implementation, coding, deployment, and more. This pursuit, in turn, propels the acquisition of new skills.

Although I had a previous website iteration, inspiration struck when I delved into the innovative development process behind [my wife's business site](https://advocatherine.expert/) ‚Äî a process that compelled me to relaunch my own site with these modern approaches. It's not just about technology; it's about relaunching myself and diving headfirst into the exciting realms of Cloud Computing, AI, MLOps, DevOps, CI/CD, and Automation.

With enthusiasm, I invite you to explore the revamped [pancheliuga.com](https://pancheliuga.com/) ‚Äî a testament to my journey and technological exploration. For a more in-depth exploration of the technical aspects, you can take a look at my project - [Attorney at Law Website](/projects/attorney-at-law-website-empowering-legal-excellence-online/), which closely mirrors... Here's a glimpse:

**Technology Stack:**

- [**Jamstack architecture**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamstack) with [**Eleventy static site generator**](https://www.11ty.dev/) as the backbone.
- **Git** as the content management system (CMS).
- Front-end trio: **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
- Leverage of **Netlify PaaS** for DNS management and CI/CD integration.

**Key Features/Highlights:**

- **Enhanced Eleventy Development Structure:** Building upon the principles of [Eleventy's config file](https://www.lenesaile.com/en/blog/organizing-the-eleventy-config-file/), I established a robust development structure.
- **Cutting-Edge Eleventy Starter Template:** I integrated the [Eleventy Excellent Starter Template](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent), providing a strong foundation for my project.
- **Embracing "Excellent Websites":** Following the philosophy of ["Excellent Websites"](https://buildexcellentwebsit.es/), I embraced modern CSS methodologies, fluid typography, flexible layouts, and progressive enhancement.
- **Efficient Image Handling:** The [Eleventy image plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/) facilitated efficient image management, enhancing the site's performance.
- **Seamless CI/CD with Netlify:** The deployment on the [Netlify platform](https://www.netlify.com/) ensured streamlined CI/CD integration and DNS management.

While I don't offer a step-by-step guide on creating a portfolio/blog website, I encourage you to explore the resources I've mentioned. By following these references and inspirations, you'll find the process relatively straightforward and empowering.

My website is a public domain, and you're welcome to draw inspiration from any part of it. The entire project is available on [==GitHub==](https://github.com/pancheliuga/pancheliuga.com_v2) for you to explore and adapt according to your needs.

It's also noteworthy to mention that my writing process has been greatly enriched with the assistance of **ChatGPT**, serving as my professional editor. The synergy of technology and creativity has been pivotal in shaping this endeavor.

I extend special gratitude to [**Andy Bell**](https://set.studio/) for his forward-looking vision of the modern web, and his all-encompassing [Eleventy course](https://learneleventyfromscratch.com/). Equally, I'm indebted to [**Lene Saile**](https://www.lenesaile.com/) for instilling structured Eleventy development methodologies.

In closure, this relaunch transcends mere technical enhancements ‚Äî it embodies a journey of self-discovery and exploration. By embracing the latest technologies and methodologies, I've not only revitalized my digital footprint but also deepened my affinity for technology's transformative potential. I invite you to embark on your own path of innovation, armed with insights from this project.
