I am from Ukraine üá∫üá¶, and I have lived in the war for two months now. [Millions of Ukrainians lost everything that mattered before](https://www.un.org/press/en/2022/sc14865.doc.htm), and the war dramatically changed our lives.

> Today we must learn to live in a new reality.

One of the key messages we hear nowadays is to be efficient and productive in your current role. I focused on my own local business for over a decade, but now I have lost my job. That's why the decision to find a remote position on the global market looks reasonable.

### The main goals of creating this website are:

- to show my skills, experience, main interests;
- to hone writing and communicational skills in storytelling;
- to be visible on the web space.

I look forward to achieving my goal, constantly thanking üôè our soldiers who are doing their best to make it my only task.
