I invite you to explore my recent project, where I embarked on a thrilling journey into AWS-based full-stack serverless development. This experience allowed me to dive deep into cloud technologies, strengthen my skills in infrastructure as code, CI/CD, and cloud architecture, and overcome exciting challenges.

I've documented my entire adventure, highlighting the skills I acquired and the obstacles I conquered during this incredible journey. If you're passionate about cloud technology and want to learn from my firsthand experience, dive into the full story on the dedicated [project webpage](/projects/cloud-resume-challenge:-showcasing-my-cloud-expertise/)

Additionally, you can explore my cloud-hosted resume at resume.pancheliuga.com and access the complete source code for this challenge on [GitHub](https://github.com/pancheliuga/cloud-resume-challenge)
