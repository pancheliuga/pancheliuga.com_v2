Hi ðŸ‘‹, this is my personal portfolio/blog website.

**Technology Stack:**

- [**Jamstack architecture**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamstack) with [**Eleventy static site generator**](https://www.11ty.dev/) as the backbone.
- **Git** as the content management system (CMS).
- Front-end trio: **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
- Leverage of **Netlify PaaS** for DNS management and CI/CD integration.

**Key Features/Highlights:**

- **Enhanced Eleventy Development Structure:** Building upon the principles of [Eleventy's config file](https://www.lenesaile.com/en/blog/organizing-the-eleventy-config-file/), I established a robust development structure.
- **Cutting-Edge Eleventy Starter Template:** I integrated the [Eleventy Excellent Starter Template](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent), providing a strong foundation for my project.
- **Embracing "Excellent Websites":** Following the philosophy of ["Excellent Websites"](https://buildexcellentwebsit.es/), I embraced modern CSS methodologies, fluid typography, flexible layouts, and progressive enhancement.
- **Efficient Image Handling:** The [Eleventy image plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/) facilitated efficient image management, enhancing the site's performance.
- **Seamless CI/CD with Netlify:** The deployment on the [Netlify platform](https://www.netlify.com/) ensured streamlined CI/CD integration and DNS management.

While I don't offer a step-by-step guide on creating a portfolio/blog website, I encourage you to explore the resources I've mentioned. By following these references and inspirations, you'll find the process relatively straightforward and empowering.

My website is a public domain, and you're welcome to draw inspiration from any part of it.

I extend special gratitude to [**Andy Bell**](https://set.studio/) for his forward-looking vision of the modern web, and his all-encompassing [Eleventy course](https://learneleventyfromscratch.com/). Equally, I'm indebted to [**Lene Saile**](https://www.lenesaile.com/) for instilling structured Eleventy development methodologies.
